If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The data is based on the average (valence, energy, danceability, speechiness)

VALENCE
Average of 0.484443

ENERGY
Average of 0.65906

DACEABILITY
Average of 0.71646

SPEECHINESS
Average of 0.115569

Conclusion:
As we can see the listener likes music that doesn't really have much speech(lyrics) in it, but a lot of danceabilty.
Which means that this person doesn't really engage in karaoke sessions but more into dancing.

Also with an average of 0.48 in valence would mean the person is more into sad music; perhaps a bad break up, depression,...
Therefore listening to music with a higher energy and a lot of danceability to vent his emotions out to keep them sane.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

First we don't know anything about the person; age, state of mind, stress levels, work, relationships,... etc
A person doesn't only listen to 100 songs. Many people also have music they listen with there friends (that everyone likes),
and music they listen in more private times. We have no idea if this file is with friends or personal.
Also everyday is different, therefore the person might be happy but listening to some sad music because it gives him some nostalgia
(remembering some good old memories).

In conclusion with more data we can learn more about the person and recommend more. In case with AI become the person.
