                <h2><b>About me</b></h2>

            <p>Greetings, I’m Grégory Charles, a Belgian native currently based in Gotenba, Shizuoka, Japan.
                My professional journey spans from teaching English communication to military personnel to embarking on an ambitious path in data science.
                As I near the completion of Harvard’s CS50 course, I am equipping myself with the skills and knowledge to excel in the ever-evolving technology landscape.
<p>As an INFJ-A, I am guided by a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to continuous improvement.
    I am dedicated to advancing my expertise through rigorous learning and real-world application, whether through structured online courses, extensive reading, or hands-on experience.</p>
<P>My interests extend beyond the professional realm into personal development, survival skills, and outdoor activities, all of which reflect my belief in the importance of resilience, adaptability, and lifelong learning.</P>
<P>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page. I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities for growth and collaboration.</p>
