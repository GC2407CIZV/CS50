                <h3>Australia</h3>
                <p>I lived in Australia for 1 year and 3 months, and it truly felt like a land of adventure. The country boasts diverse landscapes, from stunning beaches to rugged outback.

Overall, Australia’s unique charm and natural beauty made my time there unforgettable.</p>
